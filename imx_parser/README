IMX File Reader

Reads binary files in the IMX file format.
Used to define vectors/matrices of arbitrary size and the data to be stored.

Test data obtained from the http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/ MNIST Database]

Developed to aid in the completion of CS2NN16 coursework.

Description of the IMX file format:

  /************************************************************************
   * IMX File Format.
   *
   * Read the magic number, defined as four bytes at start of file.
   * First two bytes are *always* zero
   *
   * Third byte represents data type stored in data structure.
   * - 0x08: unsigned byte
   * - 0x09: signed byte
   * - 0x0B: short (2 bytes)
   * - 0x0C: int (4 bytes)
   * - 0x0D: float (4 bytes)
   * - 0x0E: double (8 bytes)
   *
   * Fourth byte stores the dimensionality of the structure
   * - 1: Vector
   * - 2: Matrices
   * If there are > 2 dimensions they are accumulated in matrix columns.
   *
   * Following this are dimension sizes.
   * Stored as four byte integers in BigEndian format.
   *
   * Finally data is stored as a series of unsigned bytes.
